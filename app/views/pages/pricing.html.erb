    Simple, sustainable and affordable pricing
  </h1>
  <p class="mt-3 text-stone-600 text-balance">
    Our pricing is simple, you pay for the number of emails you send, with no bar on the number of subscribers. There's just one plan that starts at $5 with 3,000 emails included.

  <p class="mt-2 text-stone-600 text-balance">
    We are not VC funded, we don't need to grow at blitz scale. This pricing ensures we can provide the best service to you regardless of how much you pay us.

      },
      {
        q: "Why do you not have a subscriber-based pricing model?",
        a: "Subscriber-based pricing penalizes you for growing your audience. We think that's backwards — you should only pay for the emails you actually send."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you have a free plan?",
        a: "We don't currently offer a free plan, but our paid plan starts at just $5/month which covers most small newsletter needs."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer discounts?",
        a: "We don't currently offer discounts, but our pricing is already as low as we can sustainably go."
      },
      {
        q: "Can I get a refund?",
        a: "Yes — reach out to us and we'll sort it out."

        q: "How is your offering so cheap?",
        a: "We keep our costs low by staying focused. No bloated features, no excessive infrastructure, no investor expectations to meet."
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if I don't send any emails in a billing cycle?",
        a: "You still pay the $5 base fee. Think of it as keeping your account and subscriber list active."

        q: "Is there a limit on subscribers?",
        a: "No. Grow your audience without any limits or penalties."

        q: "Is there a limit on emails?",
        a: "No hard limit — you just pay for what you send beyond the 3,000 included in your plan."
